* blesh gives a weird error about readlink, see if I can solve it
* st: solarized requires another patch before applying it, look into it before implementing it.
* st: implement something to increase the scroll speed (there are some patches)
* Too much repetition in my systemd modules (auto-rsync, do-on-request, neuron-module)
