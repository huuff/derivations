* Due to the nature of flakes, in order to check my changes I have to commit, push, and then pull in my config. This is causing me great pain, so I should look into testing.
* blesh gives a weird error about readlink, see if I can solve it
* Too much repetition in my systemd modules (auto-rsync, do-on-request)

## st
* config option for font

## autocutsel
* Synchronize only clipboard to primary selection because the other way around feels like hell. Or will it be useless then?

## mycli
* Add some configuration options instead of setting them to the default directly in the file

# thefuck
* Create the default settings.py file and add default options
